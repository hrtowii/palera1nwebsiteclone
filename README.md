# palera1n website clone
* I was bored and wanted to learn astro. I chose to remake the [palera1n](https://palera.in) website and improve on it in what I thought would make it look better.
* This uses vanilla CSS, and no other JS framework. Only Astro.
* This took me around a day to make

## Took some code from original palera1n website here, most notably the js used to detect useragent -> https://github.com/palera1n/website/
